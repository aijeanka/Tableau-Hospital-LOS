## Installation

1. Install Tableau Desktop from the [Tableau website](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop).
2. Open the provided Tableau workbook file (`HW9_Aizhan_au198.twb`) in Tableau Desktop.

## Usage

1. **Identification of Values**
   - Identify discrete vs. continuous values in the data.
   
2. **Creating Aggregate Values**
   - Create an aggregate value for hospital count (Hosp C) using the COUNT (CNT) function.
   
3. **Filtering Data**
   - Apply filters to focus on specific subsets of the data.
     - Filter for average Length of Stay (LOS) greater than Medicare LOS.
     - Filter by gender (female vs. male).
   
4. **Graph Customization**
   - Transpose graphs for better visualization.
   - Sort data in descending and ascending orders.
   - Use the "Show Me" option to explore different graph types.
   - Format titles and text, including font, size, italics, and colors.
   
5. **Enhancing Data Presentation**
   - Edit tooltips to include values and enhance clarity.
   - Apply labels and adjust size for readability.
   - Format values to avoid overlapping.
   - Use Dual Axis to present data on two axes.
   
6. **Identifying Data Issues**
   - Identify and handle a large number of ungroupable patients in the data.
